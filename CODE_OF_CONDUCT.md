## Code of Conduct

We do not adopt any document describing conduct at this point. 

However, there are a few straightforward rules to observe:

1. Treat others as you would like others to treat you.
1. Everyone is free to express ideas.
1. Truth is more important than kindness, but be kind.
1. Your contributions are under MIT license.
