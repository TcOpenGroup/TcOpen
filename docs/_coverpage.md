# Welcome to TcOpenGoup

**TcOpenGroup** develops a series of tools, libraries, and an application framework for industrial automation based on Beckhoff's TwinCAT3 platform. We bind the world of industrial automation (OT) and information technologies (IT). We aim to demonstrate that the transformation from electrical engineering to software engineering is beneficial and necessary for industrial automation.
We bring here many concepts developed and implemented at [MTS](https://www.mts.sk/en) with a lot of success in the last ten years. These ideas are now enhanced within this initiative by many inputs from contributors worldwide.
