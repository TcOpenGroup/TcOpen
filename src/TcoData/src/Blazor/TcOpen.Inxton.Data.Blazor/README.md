# Tco Data Blazor

TcOpen Framework contains a set of libraries that provide a simple yet powerful data exchange between PLC and an arbitrary data repository. TcoData implements a series of repository operations known as CRUD.

More information about usage of data framework is available [here](https://docs.tcopengroup.org/articles/TcOpenFramework/TcoData/Introduction.html).

Currently supported data repositories are:

- InMemory
- Json
