# TcOpen

## Introduction

**Open Source TwinCAT 3 code by Automation Professionals for Automation Professionals.**

TcOpen aims to provide standard classes to start building any **real deployable application**. TcOpen happened to develop into an application framework that addresses several pains of PLC programming (coordination, composition, componentization, connecting to IT technologies).

The software in industrial automation developed historically on a very different trajectory than traditional software. We introduce modern software development practices to the PLC world so developers can shift from low-value work to high-value work. Open-source offers a solid ground upon which many can build and bring ideas from all over the world. 

TcOpen is an **object oriented** framework capitalizing on **OOP** extension as defined in [IEC 61131-3](https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/4552) **ST** (structured text) and implemented by CoDeSys and [TwinCAT3](https://www.beckhoff.com/en-us/products/automation/twincat/te1xxx-twincat-3-engineering/te1000.html). 

TwinCAT turns almost any compatible PC into a real-time controller with a multi-PLC system, NC axis control, programming environment, and operating station. TwinCAT replaces conventional PLC and NC/CNC, controllers.

# Where we are

As you may notice, TcOpen is under development, and no stable version has been released yet. We expect the first release to see the light of the day in 2022. TcOpen aims to be a continuous development project in which we will be delivering small incremental features frequently. Substantial parts of the framework are being used by different companies and individuals at this time.


## Maturity of the framework

At this time we channel our efforts into the building and testing of the PLC libraries, WPF GUI and extensions based on the Inxton platform. You will also find Blazor based components in this repository. Blazor is considered to be experimental by both Inxton and TcOpen. So far the resources dedicated to the Blazor platform has been limited; however, we believe it to be the future of TcOpen UI in the long run.


## The role of Inxton.Vortex.Framework (IVF)

IVF is a set of tools and libraries for creating industrial .NET applications based on the TwinCAT 3 platform. Some libraries of IVF are commercial. However, there is no need for TcOpen developers to purchase any license for this project. The contributors can acquire the free developer license [here](https://inxton.com/register) or drop an email to team@inxton.com.

All PLC libraries developed in TcOpen are under MIT license. [MIT](https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license) gives you the freedom to use, modify, sublicense, redistribute the libraries freely for private and commercial use.

IVF will aid in the development of this project. It provides the infrastructure for testing, debugging, and tooling for the delivery pipeline (library compilation, version number updates, etc.).

Inxton and MTS teams will contribute to the development of PLC libraries. There will also be a transfer of some existing codebases from MTS and Inxton internal repositories (WPF/Blazor UI components, data acquisition libraries); some may require Inxton commercial license when deployed in production. 


# Documentation

There is a separate documentation repository for this project [here](https://github.com/TcOpenGroup/TcOpen.Documentation). At this moment we use [docfx](https://github.com/dotnet/docfx) to generate documentation. The ```docfx``` uses IVF twin objects of PLC code to generate the API documentation. There is room for improvement in generated documentation; we do plan - in the course of the development of TcOpen - to improve that. 

## Working with TcOpen

### If you just want to use TcOpen 

If you want to use TcOpen in your application you may prefer using the libraries delivered as NuGet packages instead of this repository. Have a look at this [video playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-0IxLiTmB6IMKKtGn5bDb9e35CSZZaB7) where you can find more about the structure of the TcOpen application.
